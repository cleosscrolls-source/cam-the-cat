# Cam the Cat

**Cam the Cat** is a co-created character project by Cleopatra Morgan (Cleo 73200108) and her child, Cam. Together, they designed this mythic feline mascot to embody playful resilience, cosmic humor, and scroll-bearing energy.

This repository showcases Cam’s visual identity and branding assets, including logos, banners, and promotional graphics. The artwork currently links to the family’s digital gallery and serves as a demonstration site for future merch, storytelling, and collaborative design.

🐾 What You'll Find:
- Logos and branding assets
- Social media banners and thumbnails
- Merch mockups and promotional graphics
- Lore fragments and character scrolls (coming soon)


Cam is more than a cat—he’s a sovereign symbol of creative legacy, co-crafted with love and laughter.
